# GitHub Pages .htaccess
# Note: GitHub Pages doesn't support .htaccess, but this is for reference

# For GitHub Pages, routing is handled by the 404.html fallback
# This file is kept for documentation purposes

# If you deploy to a different hosting provider that supports .htaccess,
# uncomment the following lines:

# RewriteEngine On
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
# RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
